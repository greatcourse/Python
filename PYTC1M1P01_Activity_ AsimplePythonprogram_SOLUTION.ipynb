Your supervisor mentions there's a small error and challenges you to find and fix it.\n","\n","### Instructions:\n","- Carefully read the provided code snippet and then run it.\n","- The code defines the length and width of a rectangle, calculates the area, and then attempts to print the result.\n","- Pay close attention to the output - is the calculated area correct?\n","\n","### Hints\n","- **Identify and Fix the Error:** If the output isn't what you expected, use your knowledge of how to calculate the area of a rectangle (area = length * width) to spot the error in the code. Modify one line of code to correct the calculation.\n","- **Run the Program Again:** Execute the modified script and verify that it now calculates and prints the area of the rectangle correctly. The output should clearly state the calculated area.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"598e6f33","metadata":{"id":"598e6f33","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732303535861,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":191,"user":{"displayName":"George Mount","userId":"05009073335156401284"}},"outputId":"42730803-b5bc-4ce3-8dbc-6c7fecf32bf7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The area of the rectangle is: 8\n"]}],"source":["\n","# The Code\n","\n","length = 5\n","width = 3\n","\n","# Calculate the area\n","area = length + width # Modify this line of code\n","\n","# Print the result\n","print(\"The area of the rectangle is:\", area)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"i8_JCYlfVhWG"},"id":"i8_JCYlfVhWG","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
